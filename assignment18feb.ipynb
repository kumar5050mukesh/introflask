    "REST architecture is a client-server architecture where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with data in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are based on HTTP and use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on the resources. REST APIs are simple, lightweight, and scalable, making them ideal for building web applications that require fast and efficient communication.\n",

    "SOAP architecture, on the other hand, is an XML-based messaging protocol that is used to exchange structured information between web services. SOAP messages are usually sent using HTTP or HTTPS, and they are typically larger and more complex than REST messages.
